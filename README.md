# Spliceprot 2.0 

This repository contains the SpliceProt 2.0 analysis codes. SpliceProt 2.0 is a public Proteogenomics repository that provides an even broader range of computationally translated proteins from human, mouse and rat that can be very useful to proteomic validation of splice variants absent from reference databases. The repository can also be used to identify orthologous proteoforms between human and murines. Perl and Python scripts were developed based on Ensembl Database (Release 100). 

The repository files can be downloaded from http://spliceprot.icc.fiocruz.br/download.php
